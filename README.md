# MBNotes

This plugin represents my attempt to incorporate all of my digital notes into
Vim. The basis of this foundation is Quarto, which is required for most of this
to work. Requires Vim 9.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed using whatever plugin installer you so desire. It
also depends on quarto-vim, which itself depends on vim-pandoc-syntax. For
`vim-plug`:

```vim
    Plug 'vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax'
    Plug 'quarto-dev/quarto-vim'
    Plug 'maxbucknell/vim-mbnotes'
```
